<p>If you join immediately following an Orientation, your photo will be taken during that process. Otherwise, photos for Coop Membership cards are taken in the Coop Membership Office during regular office hours. You have four weeks from the date you select a workslot to come in and have your picture taken. We will then process the photo and mail you a membership card. You can expect to receive your card in the mail approximately four weeks after you have your picture taken.</p>

<p>Until you receive your card in the mail, in order to enter the Coop you will have to ask the Entrance Worker to look you up on the "New Member List." This list is organized alphabetically by last name. Once you receive your card, swipe it at the entrance to let us know you have received it.</p>
